Subject: [PATCH 04/13] Use BLAS_USE_CBLAS_DOT for OpenBLAS builds

There are two calling conventions for *dotu functions

Result using pointer:

  void cdotu_ (openblas_complex_float *, blasint *, float  *, blasint *, float  *,  blasint *);

Result using return value:

  openblas_complex_float cdotu_ (blasint *, float  *, blasint *, float  *,  blasint *);

MKL uses the former and OpenBLAS uses the latter by default.
(There's a configuration option for openblas to do the former)
When BLAS was pure Fortran, these calling conventions depended
on the Fortran compiler.

The CBLAS API is more well behaved and has `cblas_cdotu_sub`
which returns using pointer (as the last arg instead of first arg)
and `cblas_cdotu` returns using the return value.

The workaround for openblas is to use the CBLAS API. This also
assists with the BLAS switching mechanism as we are not relying on
a particular `cdotu` implementation with the cost of two additional
functional calls.
