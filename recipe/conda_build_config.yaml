# https://github.com/conda-forge/pytorch-cpu-feedstock/pull/293#issuecomment-2503611320
# 2024/12 hmaarrfk's summary:
#   The medium term solution is to add such a constraint to libcufile
#   The long term solution is to add such a constraint to all packages
#   that depend on a specific sysroot at building.
