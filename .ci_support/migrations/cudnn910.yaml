    Rebuild for cudnn 9.10
    
    Conda-forge assumed cudnn 9.x builds would stay compatible with each other.
    This is the case for the API/ABI of the library, but nvidia dropped support
    for older GPU architectures in cudnn 9.11. Since we have no package-level
    metadata about compatibility with specific GPU architectures, this effectively
    breaks all packages built atop cudnn for users on affected older GPUs.
    
    In order to remedy this situation, we need to rebuild all cudnn-dependent
    feedstocks against cudnn 9.10 (the last version with full architecture support),
    before we mark all those newer cudnn builds as broken. This only affects artefacts
    for CUDA 12.x; those for CUDA 13.x are not affected, since CUDA 13 never supported
    those older architectures in the first place.
